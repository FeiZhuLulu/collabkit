# CollabKit

Lightweight multi-agent coordination through shared progress files.

There are two types of data in this system:

- **Progress** (automatic) — 5-line micro-logs agents write when a phase completes. Lightweight, routine, for daily sync.
- **Handoff** (manual) — Detailed session reports generated on demand. Rich context, decisions, causality, for deep agent transitions.

When the user invokes this skill, present three options and execute the chosen one.

## Option Menu

Ask the user to choose:

1. **Init** - Set up the collaboration framework for this project
2. **Handoff** - Generate a detailed session handoff report (not the same as progress — this is a full session review with context, decisions, and next steps)
3. **Sync** - Scan and display all agents' latest progress

---

## Init

Guide the user through setup with a conversational flow. Ask one question at a time, wait for answers, then generate the correct files based on their environment.

### Step 1: Which agents do you use?

Ask the user to select all that apply:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- OpenCode
- OpenClaw
- Other (ask for the name)

### Step 2: Project location

Ask: Where is your project located?

Example answer: `E:\webnovel.agent` or `/home/user/project`

Store this as the `project_path`.

### Step 3: Environment for each agent

For each agent the user selected, ask: What environment does [agent] run in?

Options:
- **Windows native** — uses Windows paths like `E:\...`
- **WSL** — uses `/mnt/e/...` style paths
- **macOS / Linux native** — uses Unix paths like `/home/...`
- **Docker / remote** — ask for the path mapping

This determines the path format each agent's rule file will use.

Example scenario:
- Claude Code → WSL (needs `/mnt/e/webnovel.agent`)
- Codex → Windows native (needs `E:\webnovel.agent`)

### Step 4: Existing files?

Ask:
- Does the project already have a CLAUDE.md? (yes/no)
- Does the project already have an AGENTS.md? (yes/no)

If yes, ask whether to overwrite or append.

### Step 5: Create directories

```bash
mkdir -p .progress/{selected_agents...},handoffs
```

Only create directories for the agents the user selected.

### Step 6: Generate CLAUDE.md

If the user uses Claude Code, create a CLAUDE.md with paths adjusted to the environment from Step 3.

**Example: Claude Code in WSL, project at `E:\webnovel.agent`**

```
# Multi-Agent Progress Sync

I am Claude Code.

The Windows project path `E:\webnovel.agent` maps to this WSL path:

`/mnt/e/webnovel.agent`

Use the shared progress directory inside the project:

- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `/mnt/e/webnovel.agent/.progress/codex/`.
- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `/mnt/e/webnovel.agent/.progress/opencode/`.
- When a phase is completed, work is paused, or handoff is needed, write progress to `/mnt/e/webnovel.agent/.progress/claude/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md`.

Keep each progress report to at most 5 lines:

- time:
- task:
- status:
- changed:
- note:

Only write to `.progress/claude/`. Do not delete old progress files.
```

**Example: Claude Code on macOS/Linux, project at `/home/user/project`**

```
# Multi-Agent Progress Sync

I am Claude Code.

Use the shared progress directory inside the project:

- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `.progress/codex/`.
- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `.progress/opencode/`.
- When a phase is completed, work is paused, or handoff is needed, write progress to `.progress/claude/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md`.

Keep each progress report to at most 5 lines:

- time:
- task:
- status:
- changed:
- note:

Only write to `.progress/claude/`. Do not delete old progress files.
```

Adjust the "Read from" lines based on which agents the user selected. Only include directories for agents that exist.

### Step 7: Generate AGENTS.md

If the user uses agents other than Claude Code, create an AGENTS.md with "If you are X" blocks for each selected agent.

```
# Multi-Agent Progress Sync

This project uses `.progress/` for lightweight multi-agent progress sync.

If you are Codex:
- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `.progress/opencode/` and `.progress/claude/`.
- Write progress only to `.progress/codex/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md`.

If you are OpenCode:
- Read the latest 2 `.md` reports from `.progress/codex/` and `.progress/claude/`.
- Write progress only to `.progress/opencode/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md`.

Write progress only when a phase is completed, work is paused, or handoff is needed.

Keep each progress report to at most 5 lines:

- time:
- task:
- status:
- changed:
- note:

Only write to your own directory. Do not delete old progress files.
```

Only include "If you are X" blocks for agents the user actually uses. Remove the others.

### Step 8: Git exclusion

Ask: Do you want to exclude AGENTS.md and .progress/ from git?

If yes, update `.git/info/exclude` (not .gitignore, to avoid polluting the project):

```
AGENTS.md
.progress/
```

### Step 9: Confirm

Summarize what was created:
- Which directories under .progress/
- Which rule files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) and where they were placed
- Path mappings applied (e.g., `E:\` → `/mnt/e/` for WSL)
- Git exclusion status
- Any existing files that were preserved or appended to

## Handoff

When the user chooses this option:

1. Review the current session's conversation context.
2. Run `git diff` to see all changes made in this session.
3. Generate a detailed handoff report with these sections:

```
# Session Handoff - [Agent Name] - [Date Time]

## Context
Why this work was done. What was the starting state.

## Decisions
Key choices made and why. Include alternatives considered.

## Changes
For each file changed:
- What was modified
- Why it was modified
- Any breaking changes

## Issues Encountered
Problems hit, how they were resolved, what to watch out for.

## Next Steps
What should be done next. Any pending tasks.

## Notes for Other Agents
Anything the next agent needs to know before picking up work.
```

4. Save to `.progress/handoffs/[agentname]_session_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHmm].md`
   - Claude Code → `claudecode_session_20260610_1435.md`
   - Codex → `codex_session_20260610_1435.md`
   - OpenCode → `opencode_session_20260610_1435.md`
   - OpenClaw → `openclaw_session_20260610_1435.md`

---

## Sync

When the user chooses this option:

1. Scan all `.progress/` subdirectories (excluding handoffs/).
2. Read the latest file in each directory.
3. Present a summary table:

```
| Agent | Last Active | Task | Status |
|-------|------------|------|--------|
| Claude | 2026-06-07 23:57 | Douyin analytics scan | done |
| Codex | 2026-06-06 00:30 | Deploy Worker | done |
```

4. If two agents' latest reports mention the same file, flag a warning:

```
Potential conflict: Claude and Codex both modified src/auth.ts
```

5. If any agent has no reports yet, show "No reports" for that agent.
